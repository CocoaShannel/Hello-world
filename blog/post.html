					<p><h2> I love volunteering at beer festivals!</h2> A little about me, my name is Amber and I love volunteering for festivals.  I started volunteering for the Strawberry Festival in Oxnard,California. I fell in love with it!  After volunteering for the Strawberry Festival in my local area at the beer booth for organization three years I wanted to see where else I can volunteer. Since I enjoy going to festivals I looked up on the internet where to volunteer.  While searching I found an organization called rockstar beer that needed volunteers.  This organization does beer themed festivals all across the United States.  They are in California, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, Massachusetts and Texas.  While in California this organization does festivals in the Los Angeles area, Orange County, and San Diego.  I emailed my information and I was contacted back by a staff member to volunteer at my first beer festival.  This was the Hollywood bowl beer festival.  It was a fun experience, so I continued to volunteer for this organization ever since!  This is a great way to meet people and be social, also another way of attending these festivals for free!  They are fun, fun, fun! </p></div>
